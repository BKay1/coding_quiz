# Code-Quiz

# To Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The quiz is to run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Methodology

Main Actions:

1.  Drafted a wireframe outlining the main tasks of building a code, which briefly are:
    - A basic html frame outlining the basic structure of the code-quiz;
    - CSS for basic styling as well as ensuring a responsive application;
    - Javascript to build the various components of the quiz itself, including the questions container and the user input.
    - a separate html and javascript file was created for the highscores part of the app.
2.  Initially compiled the html together with css to make sure I was happy with the look of the page;
3.  Then used the html as a template to create the various sections in javascript including the questions and form container;
4.  Added a timer;

6.  The code-quiz was successful in being deployed!!!!!!!AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!
