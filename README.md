# Code-Quiz

# To Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The quiz is to run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Methodology

Main Actions:

1.  Drafted a wireframe outlining the main tasks of building a code, which briefly are:
    - A basic html framework outlining the basic structure of the code-quiz;
    - CSS for basic styling as well as ensuring a responsive application;
    - Javascript to build the various components of the quiz itself, including the questions container and the user input.
    - a separate html and javascript file was created for the highscores part of the app.
2.  Initially compiled the html together with css to make sure I was happy with the look of the page;
3.  Then used the html as a template to create the various sections in javascript including the questions and form container;
4.  Added a timer which included a 5 second deduction feature if the user gets a question wrong.
5.  Upon completion of the quiz if the time runs out the user can add there initials via a form to be added to the highscores output.
6.  The user is then directed to the highscores page listing recent games as well as an option to go back to the beginning to restart the quiz.
7.  The highscores are available in local storage and can be cleared on the click of a button.
8.  The code-quiz was successful in being deployed!
